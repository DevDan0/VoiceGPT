# VoiceGPT
ChatGPT but I added voice assistance to it
Basically it recognizes your voice, feeds it to ChatGPT and gets a response back in TTS
*You need to generate your own [ChatGPT API Key](https://platform.openai.com/) and Enter it into the given place in main.py

# Prerequisites
[Speech Recognition Module](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
[PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
